# Zone 1 — Outcomes & Next Steps

## Zone 1 Exit Criteria

Your retrieval agent must meet the following requirements before moving on.

**Required**:

- A retrieval-based agent is created and accessible  
- The agent is grounded in the dataset  
- The agent can answer at least three realistic, portfolio-level questions  
- The agent does not fabricate answers when data is missing or unclear  

**Stronger (Optional)**:

These are not required, but indicate a higher-quality agent:

- Responses are well structured and easy to scan  
- The agent clearly explains data gaps or ambiguity

If any of the required criteria above are not met, pause here:

- Revisit your agent instructions  
- Continue testing and refining  
- Or ask a coach for help  

Do not proceed until your agent meets these requirements.
