# Challenge: Design for the Real World

So far, you’ve explored agents from multiple angles:

- **Zone 1:** Retrieval-based agents  
- **Zone 2:** Multi-step agent experiences  
- **Zone 3:** Bringing those concepts together in Azure AI Foundry  

This final challenge isn’t about learning new features — it’s about **bringing everything together**.

Rather than thinking in terms of tools, think in terms of **outcomes**:

> *What real problem could an agent system help solve — and how would you design it so it could actually work in the real world?*

## Your challenge

As a **group**, choose a real-world scenario from your day-to-day work that could be improved with AI agents.

**Examples:**

- Exploring or summarizing customer history or CRM data  
- Helping sellers or support teams get oriented faster  
- Automating part of a workflow (triage, follow-ups, handoffs)  
- Reducing time spent searching across data  

Design an **agent system** to address that scenario. You are **not expected to fully build everything** — focus on a design that could realistically be implemented.

### Optional: Align with the Agent Design Template

Use the **Agent Design Template** to quickly align on:

- The problem  
- The user  
- The data  
- What the agent helps with  

Don’t overthink this — it’s just a starting point.

> [!NOTE]
> The template is available in the **Lab Docs** folder on the lab desktop.

### Build What You Can

Using the provided sample data:

- Extend your agent  
- Add or modify workflows  
- Introduce other agents if useful  

Aim for something that:

- Works in the lab **today**
- Could connect to real data **tomorrow**

### Reference (use as needed)

**What you already created in Azure AI Foundry:**

- A retrieval-based agent (`crm-data-access-agent`)
- An initial workflow (`crm-workflow`)

You can reuse, extend, or replace these — no need to start over.

## Files

All files are available on the lab environment’s desktop.

- **Lab Docs/**
  - **Sample Docs/**
    - `CRM_Synthetics_JSON_Data.json`
  - **Zone 3 – Agent Design Template/**
    - `Zone_3_Agent_Design_Template.docx`

**Where to Work**:

- Azure AI Foundry Portal (UI)
- Visual Studio Code

Choose what helps your team move fastest.
