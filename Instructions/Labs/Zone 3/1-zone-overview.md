# 🔵 Zone 3: Design & Orchestrate an Agent System (Azure AI Foundry)

**Suggested Time:** ~65 minutes

## Overview

In Zone 3, you'll design and orchestrate an **agent system** using **Azure AI Foundry**.

Real-world agent systems are rarely a single agent solving a single problem.

They are systems of responsibility — agents, workflows, and data working together with clear boundaries.

This zone shifts your focus from building agents to designing agent systems.

It brings together everything you built in earlier zones:

- **Zone 1:** Data grounding and retrieval  
- **Zone 2:** Reasoning, routing, and conversation flow  

Rather than focusing on a single agent or scripted scenario, this zone focuses on **system-level design** — how agents, workflows, and data work together to solve a real problem.

## What success looks like

By the end of this zone, you'll have:

- A clearly defined **real-world scenario**
- At least one **grounded agent** using the provided data
- A **workflow** that orchestrates agent behavior
- A design that could realistically extend to real data or systems

You aren't expected to fully build or automate everything.

## How to approach this zone

You are not optimizing for completeness here. You are optimizing for design clarity and plausibility.

This zone has **two parts**:

### 🧱 Part 1: Baseline setup

Follow the guided steps to:

- Create a Foundry project  
- Deploy a model  
- Create a retrieval-based agent  
- Create a simple workflow  

This gives everyone a common starting point.

### 🧠 Part 2: Design challenge

Working as a group, extend or redesign what you built to support a **real-world scenario** from your day-to-day work.

Focus on **clarity of design**, not completeness.

## What you’re working with

- The same **synthetic datasets** used in earlier zones, converted to **JSON files** for use in Azure AI Foundry
- Azure AI Foundry (portal or VS Code)  
- An optional **Agent Design Template** for alignment
