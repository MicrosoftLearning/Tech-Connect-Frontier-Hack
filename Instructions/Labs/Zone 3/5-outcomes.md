# Zone 3 — Outcomes & Next Steps

## Zone 3 Exit Criteria

Your team’s agent system must meet the following requirements before completing Zone 3.

**Required**:

- Clearly states the **real-world scenario** the agent system is designed to support  
- Uses the provided **sample data** as a stand-in for real-world systems  
- Demonstrates at least **one grounded agent interaction** (responses based only on available data)  
- Includes at least **one workflow or orchestration step**  
  (for example: routing, sequencing, or conditional logic)  
- Explains how the design could **extend to real data or systems** outside the lab  

**Stronger (Optional)**:

These aren't required, but indicate a more complete or advanced design:

- Uses **multiple agents** with distinct responsibilities  
- Implements a **router or intent-based decision point**  
- Returns **structured outputs** (tables, lists, or cards)  
- Handles missing or ambiguous data gracefully  
- Demonstrates how the agent could be grounded in **dynamic or external data sources**  
  (for example, an MCP server, Bing search grounding, or another live system in a real-world deployment)  
- Shows a realistic **end-to-end workflow** from user request to response  

If any of the **required** criteria above aren't met, pause here:

- Clarify the scenario you’re solving  
- Simplify the agent system design  
- Reduce scope to a single core interaction  
- Or ask a coach for guidance  

Don't move on until the required criteria are met.

## Next Steps

You’ve completed the **Frontier Hack** 🎉

If you have extra time, feel free to:

- Revisit earlier zones and extend your agents
- Explore a different zone you haven’t tried yet
- Go deeper on an optional challenge or stretch goal

There’s no required order — follow what interests you most.
