## Challenge: Go Beyond the Script

Up to this point, you’ve followed a guided path to build and wire up your agent. Now it’s your turn.

**With your group**, design and implement **one meaningful enhancement** to your agent that goes beyond its current capabilities.

Your enhancement could include (but is not limited to):

- A **new topic** that supports a scenario the agent does not currently handle  
- Additional **routing logic** based on user intent or opportunity data  
- A **multi-turn conversation** that gathers more context before responding  
- An improvement to an existing topic that makes the output more useful, clearer, or more realistic  

There is no single correct solution. This task is intentionally open-ended.

### Guidelines

Your solution should:

- Use the existing **CRM dataset** as its source of truth  
- Remain **data-grounded** (do not infer or invent missing information)  
- Improve how the agent supports a real customer or seller conversation  

When you’re finished, test your agent and be prepared to share **as a group**:

- What you added  
- Why you added it  
- What problem it solves  

This challenge is about judgment, tradeoffs, and design - not just wiring things together.
