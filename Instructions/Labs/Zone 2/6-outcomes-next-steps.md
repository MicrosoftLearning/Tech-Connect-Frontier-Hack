# Zone 2 — Outcomes & Next Steps

## Zone 2 Exit Criteria

Your agent must meet the following requirements before moving on.

**Required**

- Includes a **central intent analysis topic**  
- Correctly routes user requests to at least **two different topic paths** (for example, summary vs. details)  
- Responses are grounded **only** in the provided CRM dataset  
- Does not fabricate answers when data is missing or unclear  
- Conversation paths end cleanly without looping or stalling  

**Stronger (Optional)**

These are not required, but indicate a higher-quality agent and completion of the optional **Challenge**:

- Offers to take an action after analysis (for example, schedule a follow-up, post to Teams, or draft an email)  
- Requires **explicit user confirmation** before taking any action  
- Implements actions using a **sub-agent**, a **flow**, or both  
- Demonstrates a clear transition from **insight → action**  

If any of the **required** criteria above are not met, pause here:

- Revisit your intent analysis logic  
- Test additional prompts and edge cases  
- Adjust routing conditions or topic boundaries  
- Or ask a coach for help  

Do not proceed until your agent meets these requirements.
