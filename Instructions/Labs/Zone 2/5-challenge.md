# Challenge: Go Beyond the Script

By this point, you’ve either followed the guided steps or built your own working agent in Copilot Studio.

**With your group**, design and implement **one meaningful enhancement** that goes beyond the current scenario.

> If you are short on time, you may skip this challenge and proceed directly to **Outcomes & Next Steps**.

## Challenge Focus (choose one)

Pick **one** of the following directions.

### Option 1: Agentic orchestration (recommended)

Extend your agent so that, after analyzing an opportunity, it can **offer to take an action** and carry it out **only with user confirmation**.

Examples include:

- Creating a follow-up calendar event  
- Posting a summary or risk alert to a Teams channel  
- Drafting (and optionally sending) an email  

You may implement this using:

- A **sub-agent**  
- A **flow triggered from the agent**  
- Or a combination of both  

The exact implementation is up to you.

### Option 2: Smarter Reasoning and Routing

Improve the agent’s behavior by adding:

- Additional intent categories  
- Multi-turn clarification before responding  
- Richer, more structured outputs  

## Guidelines

Your solution should:

- Use the existing **CRM dataset** as its source of truth  
- Remain **data-grounded** (do not infer or invent missing information)  
- Require **explicit user confirmation** before taking any action  
- Improve how the agent supports a realistic customer or seller workflow  

This challenge is about **judgment, orchestration, and design** — not just wiring things together.
